# IAB Liaison Coordinator Job Description

As the IAB's charter, "[t]he IAB acts as representative of the interests of the IETF and the Internet Society in
technical liaison relationships with other organizations concerned with standards and other technical
and organizational issues relevant to the world-wide Internet." 
That representation is carried out by liaison managers (see also https://www.ietf.org/about/liaisons/), who are selected from the community by the IAB.
Liaison managers are overseen by the IAB with the help of the IAB Liaison Coordinator.

The IAB Liaison Coordinator role is usually executed by two IAB members, where one act as the primary contact and the as back-up.
However, it is oft course also possible to split up some of the tasked listed below as long as responsibilities are clearly assigned.

The IAB assigns the Liaison Coordinator role similar as other liaison position in its March pre-IETF meeting and therefore may change
the assignment on a yearly basis. However, it is recommended to only switch over on person at a time to have a smoother transition.

There is no requirement to have knowledge about each or even any of the associated organization that we maintain liaison for, given
there is usually not a single person that has that know or potentially not even any person at the time on the IAB that can cover knowledge
about certain other SDOs. However, it is useful for the role to have know about the liaison management process and handling of liaison
statements. 

For more information about the procedures that govern IETF liaisons, can be found in RFC 4052 “IAB Liaison Management” and
RFC 4053 (BCP 103) “Procedures for Handling Liaison Statements to and from the IETF.”

Also there is a wiki about submitting and receiving liaison statement: <add link of page to create>

<ToDo: Create further wiki page about process of other SDOs and link here>

Emails to liaison-coordination@iab.org are redirected to the assigned IAB members. However, it is not expected that the Liaison Coordinator(s) necessarily
replies to all requests directly, rather than helping to forward any requests to the right liaison manager or the IAB.

## Liaison Coordinator Tasks

* Communication with the liaison managers as well as toward the rest of the IAB: The Liaison Coordinator has a bridging function between the liaison manager and the IAB. 
* Reporting and frequent status check with thee liaison manager. This depends on how active the liaison relationship which varies widely. However, it is still recommended to check at least once a year, even if a liaison is other dormant. 
* Oversight of the total and send liaison statement, e.g. to check that statement that need a reply get a reply.
* Help with finding within the IETF experts when needed to handle a liaison statement. Usually working group chairs and ADs, e.g. when the statement is related to an active working group document, are the first landing point. However, if no active group exists, it’s recommended to with the rest of the IAB for people to involve as this is already a group of expert with a wide range of knowledge.
* Help finding replacements for liaison managers. Usually the leaving liaison manager is another good source to involved. However, if no suitable person can be identified easily, the IAB might also send out a public call.
* Hep establishing new liaison. If a new liaison is established, the rest of the IAB should be involved. The liaison manager might help with the processing or might help finding an expert that can help instead.
