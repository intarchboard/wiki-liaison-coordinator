# IAB Liaison Coordinator Job Description

As the IAB's charter, "[t]he IAB acts as representative of the interests of the IETF and the Internet Society in
technical liaison relationships with other organizations concerned with standards and other technical
and organizational issues relevant to the world-wide Internet." 
That representation is carried out by liaison managers (see also
https://www.ietf.org/about/liaisons/), who are selected from the IETF
community by the IAB based on gathered feedback about the candidates.
Liaison managers are overseen by the IAB with the help of the IAB Liaison Coordinator.

The IAB Liaison Coordinator role is usually executed by two IAB members, where one acts as the primary contact and the other as back-up.
However, it is also possible to split up some of the tasks listed
below between the two assigned members as long as responsibilities are clearly assigned.

The IAB assigns the Liaison Coordinator role during the process of
selecting all of the annual IAB roles during its March pre-IETF
meeting. However, it is recommended to use two year Liaison
Coordinator terms by only switching one person per year to enable smoother transitions.

There is no requirement to have knowledge about each, or even any, of
the associated organizations that we maintain liaisonships for, given
there is usually not a single person on the IAB that has that
knowledge covering all the Standard Development Organizations (SDOs)
with which the IAB has liason relationships. However, it is useful for
the role members to have knowledge about the liaison management
process and about handling of liaison statements.

More information about the procedures that govern IETF liaisons can be found in RFC 4052 “IAB Liaison Management” and
RFC 4053 (BCP 103) “Procedures for Handling Liaison Statements to and from the IETF.”

There is also a wiki about submitting and receiving liaison statements: <add link of page to create>

<ToDo: Create further wiki page about process of other SDOs and link here>

Emails to the liaison-coordination@iab.org mail alias are redirected to the assigned IAB members. However, it is not expected that the Liaison Coordinator(s) necessarily
reply to all requests directly, but rather help by forwarding any
requests to the right liaison manager or to the entire IAB.

## Liaison Coordinator Tasks

* Handling communication between the liaison managers and the rest of the IAB.
* Performing status checks with and gathering reports from the liaison
  managers. This level of effort depends on how active a particular
  liaison relationship is, which can vary widely depending on the
  SDOs. It is recommended that Liaison Coordinators check in with
  Liaison managers at least once a year, even if a liaison is
  otherwise dormant. Some liaisons are quite active and, e.g., have
  their own mailing list or frequent meetings (likely around each IETF
  meetings). The liaison coordination is recommended to join those
  mailing lists and meetings, if suitable, but may also decide to rely
  on direct reporting from the liaison manager instead. These reports
  should be provided to the IAB and published in the IAB minutes (if
  they contain actual news).
* Overseeing the status of all liaison statements; e.g., checking that
  statements that need a reply get a reply.
* Finding experts from within the IETF when needed to handle a liaison
  statement. These experts will usually be working group chairs and
  area directors when the statement is related to an active working
  group document. If no active group or clear expert can be found, the
  responsibility falls back on the IAB as a whole, which should themselves
  consist of experts with a wide range of knowledge.
* Finding replacements for liaison managers when they step down. The
  outgoing liaison manager will often be able to help by referring
  potential replacement candidates. However, if no suitable person can
  be easily identified, the coordinator may recommend that the IAB
  sends out a public call for volunteers.
* Helping establish new liaison relationships. If a new liaison to a
  new SDO is established, the entire IAB should be involved. The
  liaison coordinator will help lead the process or identify an expert
  who can perform this role.
